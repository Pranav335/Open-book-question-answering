            " BACKGROUND .The present invention relates to a spray drying method for preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising a solid amorphous dispersion of a sparingly soluble drug and a polymer. . . Curatolo et al. EP 0 901 786 A2 . . .The formation of a solid amorphous dispersion of the drug and polymer is sometimes desirable. One of the reasons for the formation of a solid amorphous dispersion is the possibility of increasing the concentration of a water soluble drug by forming an amorphous dispersion of this drug and polymer. For example Curatolo et al. EP 0 901 786 A2 disclose the formation of a pharmaceutical spray dried dispersion of sparingly soluble drugs and a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymer succinate acetate. Such a solid amorphous dispersion of the drug and polymer provides higher concentrations of the drug dissolved in the aqueous solution as compared to the drug in crystalline form. Such a solid amorphous dispersion tends to be most effective when homogeneous dispersion of the drug in the entire amount of the polymer. . . . . . . . .Although spray drying methods have been widely studied spray dried solid amorphous dispersions provide a number of unique perspectives. Spray drying involves dissolving the drug and polymer in a solvent to form a spray solution spraying the spray solution to form droplets and then rapidly evaporating the solvent from the droplets to form a solid amorphous dispersion in the form of small particles. Particles of a solid amorphous dispersion are preferably homogeneous solid dispersions of an amorphous drug in a polymer. It is often desirable that the drug in a solid amorphous dispersion be in an amount exceeding the solubility of the drug in the polymer in the absence of a solvent and it is desirable that the drug remains homogeneously dispersed in the polymer rather than stratified into drug saturated regions. Such homogeneous solid amorphous dispersions are called thermodynamically unstable . For the formation of such dispersions by spray drying it is necessary to quickly evaporate the solvent from droplets of the sprayed solution thereby leading to a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion. However rapid evaporation of the solvent often leads to the formation of particles that are either very small or have a very low density high specific volume or both. Such particle properties can impede the processing of the material and the formation of dosage forms containing particles of a solid amorphous dispersion. . . . . . . . . .On the contrary drying conditions aimed at promoting the increase and compaction of particles can lead to other problems. Firstly the slow evaporation of the solvent from droplets of the sprayed solution can lead to the separation of the drug and the polymer during the evaporation of the droplets with the formation of inhomogeneous phase separated dispersions. That is the solid dispersion contains a phase rich in a drug and a phase rich in a polymer. Secondly drying conditions that contribute to the increase and compaction of particles can lead to high levels of residual solvent in a solid amorphous dispersion. This is undesirable for at least two reasons. Firstly as a result of high levels of residual solvent in the particles of the solid amorphous dispersion an inhomogeneous dispersion can be obtained in which the phases of the drug and polymer are separated. Secondly with an increase in the amount of residual solvent the yield of the spray dried product decreases due to incomplete drying of the droplets which leads to the adhesion of wet droplets to various parts of the dryer. The polymer and the drug which adhere to the surfaces of the dryer not only reduce the yield of the product but can also come off the surface and be present in the product in the form of large inhomogeneous particles or lumps. If the material is exposed to high temperatures for a longer time than the bulk of the spray dried material higher levels of impurities are often present in such material. . .In addition for the commercial production of large quantities of particles of a solid amorphous dispersion the use of a large volume of solvent is necessary. In the conventional method of spray drying large quantities of spray solution it is necessary to be able to strike a balance between the need for rapid evaporation of the solvent to form a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion and the need for the formation of particles with the desired levels of residual solvent and performance. . .Finally it is often desirable to utilize a drying gas such as nitrogen which is inert and reduces the possibility of fire or explosion. It is desirable to minimize the use of such gases due to their high cost as well as to minimize the amount of evaporated solvent since in the future vapors of such gases are used. .Accordingly there remains a need for a spray drying method for preparing a pharmaceutical composition of a solid amorphous dispersion containing drugs with low solubility and polymers which will allow for large quantities of spray dried solid amorphous dispersions that are homogeneous dense and have a low residual solvent content. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION . . . . 500 . T 20 . 10 T T .In one aspect a method of forming a pharmaceutical composition comprising a solid amorphous dispersion comprising a drug and a polymer comprising the following steps is provided. SUBSTANCE drying apparatus having a sprayer associated with a drying chamber a drying chamber having an inlet and an outlet is provided. A spray solution is formed by dissolving a low solubility drug and a polymer in a solvent. As described below a sparingly soluble drug has a low solubility in aqueous solutions. The nebulized solution is sprayed into the chamber through a nebulizer to form droplets having an average volume of less than 500 microns. The drying gas passes through the inlet at a flow rate and an inlet temperature T such that the droplets harden faster than in about 20 seconds. The feed rate of the spray solution is at least 10 kg h the regulation feed rate of the spray solution and drying gas input T is performed so that the drying gas at the outlet exit has a temperature T that is below the boiling point of the solvent. T . T .The authors of the present invention revealed that although the properties of the spray dried dispersions can vary greatly depending on the spray drying conditions it is shown that the temperature of the exhaust drying gas at the outlet or T outlet is crucial for creating a solid amorphous dispersion which is homogeneous dense and having a low volume of residual solvent. Thus in proportion to increasing amounts of the spray solution and drying gas volume carrying out spray drying it is necessary to regulate the rate of each stream to maintain the values T output below the boiling point of the solvent. . . . . . T . T . .The authors of the present invention revealed that for the formation of solid amorphous dispersions which are essentially homogeneous dense and having a low residual volume of solvent it is desirable to spray dry the sprayed solution under relatively cool and dry conditions. Thus in contrast to the present invention conventional spray drying methods utilize hot drying conditions that quickly evaporate the solvent. Typically to obtain maximum product production using a spray dryer the spray solution is supplied to the machine at the capacity limit of the dryer. Since the dryer limits the flow rate of the drying gas the drying gas is heated to very high temperatures to provide sufficient energy for the solvent to evaporate. As described in great detail below the inventors of the present invention have found that conventional high temperature spray drying conditions do not contribute to the creation of amorphous dispersions that are homogeneous dense and have a low residual solvent volume. Instead it is necessary to control the temperature of the drying gas at the inlet and the feed rate of the sprayed solution to maintain relatively cool conditions in the drying chamber which is determined by the temperature T of the outlet of the drying gas at the exit. In addition dry conditions are selected that is if there is a sufficient excess of drying gas in the drying chamber with respect to the solvent so that the evaporation of the solvent proceeds quickly despite the lower inlet temperature of the drying gas inlet. This leads to the formation of a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion with a higher ratio of drug to polymer than can be obtained by conventional production methods which is one of the resulting advantages of this method. . . . 500 .

SUBSTANCE drying apparatus having a sprayer associated with a drying chamber a drying chamber having an inlet and an outlet is provided. The formation of a spray solution occurs by dissolving a sparingly soluble drug and polymer in a solvent. The sprayed solution is sprayed into the chamber through the atomizer to form droplets having an average volume of less than 500 microns. The drying gas passes through the inlet at such a flow rate and inlet temperature T that the droplets harden faster than in about 20 seconds. The drying gas passing through the inlet further comprises a solvent in vapor form. In preferred embodiments of the present aspect the drying gas leaving the drying chamber through the solvent storage system is recycled to the inlet and the solvent storage system before the drying gas is again passed through the inlet removes only part of the solvent from the drying gas.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION . . .The present invention relates to spray drying methods for forming pharmaceutical compositions containing a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion of a sparingly soluble drug and polymer and in particular to spray drying methods for large volumes of a spray solution to form a solid amorphous dispersion in large quantities. In the present method the formation of homogeneous solid amorphous dispersions begins with the dissolution of a sparingly soluble drug and polymer in a solvent to form a spray solution. Then the solvent is quickly removed to form a solid amorphous dispersion. . .The concentration of the drug in the resulting dispersion formed by the method disclosed in the present invention may be lower than the solubility of the drug in the polymer at room temperature . Such a dispersion is called thermodynamically stable dispersion and is usually homogeneous that is the drug is substantially homogeneously dispersed in the polymer at the molecular level and thus can be considered a solid solution. . . . . . .Often when the concentration of the drug in the polymer exceeds its solubility it is desirable to maintain the homogeneity of the dispersion formed. Such a dispersion is called thermodynamically unstable. The key to the formation of a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion which is thermodynamically unstable is the rapid removal of the solvent. If the time scale for removing solvent from the spray solution is shorter than the time scale at which the drug and polymer phases separate from the spray solution as the solvent evaporates then a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion may form even when the concentration of the drug in the polymer exceeds its solubility and therefore the dispersion thermodynamically unstable. However the rate at which the solvent is removed strongly affects the physical properties of the resulting amorphous dispersion. Described in more detail below are the desirable properties of the solid amorphous dispersion and the spray drying conditions necessary to achieve these properties. SOLIDAMORPHIC DISPERSIONS I. I. Desired Properties of Solid Amorphous Dispersions . in vitro in vivo . . 1 2 3 4 .In order to achieve an increase in the concentration of a sparingly soluble drug under aqueous conditions of use a solid amorphous dispersion must have a number of properties. The aqueous conditions of use can be both in vitro conditions of use such as a solubility test environment and in vivo conditions of use such as the gastrointestinal tract GIT . The degree of increase in the concentration of the dissolved drug is described in more detail below but in general the introduction of the dispersion in aqueous conditions of use provides at least a temporary concentration of the dissolved drug in the conditions of use which is greater than the solubility of the transparent form of the drug in the conditions of use. A solid amorphous dispersion that provides an increase in concentration under conditions of use has the following characteristics 1 the solid dispersion is substantially homogeneous 2 the drug is essentially amorphous 3 the solid dispersion has a relatively high drug content and 4 the solid dispersion has a low residual solvent content. 1. 1. Essentially homogeneous 20 . 10 . . T . T . T 10 100 .As used herein the term substantially homogeneous means that the amount of drug present in relatively pure amorphous regions within a solid amorphous dispersion is relatively small on the order of less than 20 . Preferred is the amount of the drug present in pure amorphous regions representing less than 10 of the total amount of the drug. In dispersions essentially homogeneous the drug is dispersed as homogeneously as possible throughout the polymer and can be considered a solid solution of the drug dispersed in the polymer polymers. Although some drug rich regions may be present in the dispersion it is preferred that the dispersion itself has a glass transition temperature T c which indicates that the dispersion is substantially homogeneous. In contrast a simple physical mixture of pure amorphous drug particles and pure amorphous polymer particles as a whole shows two different T c one of which is the glass transition temperature of the drug and the other belongs to the polymer. The T c used in the present invention is the characteristic temperature at which the glassy material undergoes a relatively rapid for example 10 to 100 seconds change in physical properties from a glassy state to a rubbery state upon gradual heating. T . T . . . . . T . T 40 C 60 C. T . T 40 C 60 C 50 . T 70 C T 40 C 50 70 C 100 C.To preserve the homogeneity of the solid amorphous dispersion for some time it is desirable that T with the solid amorphous dispersion be higher than the ambient storage temperature. The fluidity of the drug in a solid amorphous dispersion depends on T with a solid amorphous dispersion. Flowability refers to the ability of a drug to diffuse through solid material. With a high fluidity of the drug in a solid amorphous dispersion the drug from a homogeneous solid solution of the drug and the polymer can separate into phases to form separate sections rich in the drug. In turn such individual drug rich sites may crystallize. In such cases the resulting inhomogeneous dispersion tends to provide lower relatively homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion concentrations of the drug dissolved in the aqueous solution and reduce bioavailability. The fluidity of the drug decreases sharply when T with a solid amorphous dispersion exceeds ambient temperature. In particular it is preferable that T with a solid amorphous dispersion is at least 40 C and preferably at least 60 C. Since T c is a function of the water and solvent content in the solid amorphous dispersion which in turn is a function of the relative humidity RH at which the solid amorphous dispersion is found these values of T c refer to T with a solid amorphous dispersion containing water in an amount that is in equilibrium with OM equivalent to that established during storage. Preferably the T with amorphous dispersion is at least 40 C and preferably at least 60 C when measured at an OB of 50 . When the drug itself has a relatively low T c about 70 C or lower it is preferred that the dispersion polymer has a T c of at least 40 C with an RH of 50 preferably at least 70 C and more preferably higher 100 C. 2. 2. Essentially amorphous . 75 . 25 . . 90 . 10 . . .However the drug in the dispersion is substantially amorphous. Used in the present invention the term essentially amorphous means that the amount of the drug in amorphous form is at least 75 wt. that is the amount of crystalline drug present does not exceed about 25 wt. . More preferably the drug in the dispersion is almost completely amorphous and this means that at least 90 wt. Of the drug is in amorphous form or that the amount of the drug in crystalline form does not exceed 10 wt. . Quantities of crystalline drug can be measured by X ray powder diffraction scanning electron microscopy SEM differential scanning calorimetry DSC or any other standard quantitative measurement method. . .To obtain the maximum concentration level of the dissolved drug and increase bioavailability in particular after storage for a long time before use it is preferable that the drug remains in the amorphous state for as long as possible. The present inventors have found that this can best be achieved when the glass transition temperature of the solid amorphous dispersion T c is substantially higher than the storage temperature of the dispersion as described above. 3. 3. Amount of drug . . . . 0 01 49 1 . 98 . . 0 05 4 8 . 0 10 9 . 0 25 20 . . 0 67 40 . . 2 5 71 . 1 5 60 . .In order to reduce the amount of inactive material during dosing it is usually desirable that the drug is present in the solid amorphous dispersion in the maximum possible amount and the dispersion remains effective for example when dosing in animals such as mammals the concentration of the dissolved drug in the conditions of use and bioavailability increase The amount of drug relative to the amount of polymer present in the solid amorphous dispersion of the present invention depends on the drug and polymer. Often the amount of drug present exceeds the solubility of the drug in the polymer. The present invention allows the drug to be present in a solid amorphous dispersion in an amount exceeding its solubility in the polymer while remaining homogeneously dispersed. By the ratio of the weight of the drug to the polymer the amount of the drug can vary widely from about 0.01 to about 49 for example from 1 wt. Of the drug to 98 wt. Of the drug . However in most cases it is preferred that the drug polymer ratio is at least about 0.05 4.8 by weight of the drug more preferably at least 0.10 9 by weight of the drug and even more preferably at least about 0.25 20 by weight of the drug . Depending on the choice of drug and polymer higher ratios are possible such as at least 0.67 40 by weight of the drug . However in some cases the degree of concentration increase decreases with a high drug content and thus the drug polymer ratio for some dispersions may be less than about 2.5 71 by weight of the drug and may even be less than about 1 5 60 wt. The drug . . 80 . 90 100 . .In addition it is preferable that in the dispersion relative to other excipients there is a large amount of drug and polymer. The drug and polymer together preferably comprise at least 80 wt. Of the dispersion and can comprise at least 90 and up to 100 wt. Of a solid amorphous dispersion. 4. 4. Low residual solvent content . . . . 10 . 5 . 3 . .The solid amorphous dispersion also has a low residual solvent content. By residual solvent content is meant the amount of solvent present in the solid amorphous dispersion after spray drying directly at the outlet of the spray dryer. The presence of solvent in the dispersion lowers the glass transition temperature of the dispersion. Thus the fluidity of the drug in the dispersion and therefore its tendency to phase separation and crystallization decreases with a decrease in the amount of residual solvent in the solid amorphous dispersion. In general the residual solvent content in the amorphous dispersion should be less than about 10 wt. Preferably less than about 5 wt. And most preferably less than 3 wt. . II. II. Desired size and dispersion density . 1 2 .In addition to the properties described above it is also desirable for solid amorphous dispersions to have certain characteristics that facilitate processing and the process. Dispersions should have the following characteristics that facilitate processing 1 dispersions should not be too small and 2 dispersions must be dense. 1. 1. Size . 1 . 500 200 100 . 1 100 5 80 . Malvern.In general solid amorphous dispersions formed by spray drying exit the drying chamber in the form of small particles. Although small particles can in some cases facilitate dissolution very small particles in particular a pulverulent fraction for example less than about 1 m in diameter can cause difficulties in processing and carrying out the process. In general the average particle size should be less than 500 microns in diameter and more preferably less than 200 microns in diameter and most preferably less than 100 microns in diameter. A preferred particle diameter range is from about 1 to about 100 microns and more preferably from about 5 microns to about 80 microns. Particle size can be measured using generally accepted techniques such as using the Malvern laser scattering apparatus. 1 . 3 2 5. The solid amorphous dispersions preferably have a relatively narrow particle size distribution in order to minimize the fraction of very small less than 1 m particles. Particles may have an interval of less than or equal to 3 and more preferably less than or approximately equal to 2.5. Used in the present invention Interval is defined as D10 10 D50 50 D90 90 .in which D 10 is the diameter corresponding to the diameter of particles that make up 10 of the total volume containing particles of equal or smaller diameter D 50 is the diameter corresponding to the diameter of particles that make up 50 of the total volume containing particles of equal or smaller diameter and D 90 is a diameter corresponding to the diameter of particles that make up 90 of the total volume containing particles of equal or smaller diameter. 2. 2.

The particle density of the solid amorphous dispersions should be at least 0.1 g cm 3 . Density can be measured by taking a representative sample determining the mass and then determining the volume of the sample in a graduated cylinder. Particles have a preferred density of at least 0.15 g cm 3 and more preferably more than 0.2 g cm 3 . In other words the bulk specific volume of the particles should be no more than 10 g cm 3 preferably less than 6.7 g cm 3 and preferably less than 5 g cm 3 . The particles may have a detectable specific volume of less than or equal to about 8 g cm 3 more preferably less than 5 g cm 3 and most preferably less than or equal to about 3.5 g cm 3 . Particles can have a Hausner coefficient of less than or equal to about 3 and more preferably less than or equal to about 2 Hausner coefficient is the ratio of bulk specific volume to detectable specific volume .

An exemplary spray drying system is shown schematically in FIG. 1. The spray drying system 10 includes tanks or bins for the drug 12 polymer 14 and solvent 16. The system 10 includes a tank 16 for mixing the spray solution using a mixer 20. The spray solution contains dissolved drug and polymer in solvent. The solvent tank 22 may optionally be used as an auxiliary during the process. The reservoir 18 is connected through a supply line 24 having a pump 26 to the drying chamber 28. The supply line 24 is connected to a sprayer 30 located on top of the chamber 28. The sprayer 30 breaks the sprayed solution into dust droplets in the drying chamber 28. A drying gas such as nitrogen also enters the chamber through the gas dispersant 32. The drying gas enters the drying chamber 28 through the inlet 34. The solvent evaporates from droplets inside the chamber 28 to form particles of a solid amorphous dispersion of the drug and polymer. The particles of the solid amorphous dispersion and the exhaust drying gas at this point the cooled drying gas and the evaporated solvent exit the drying chamber 28 from the outlet 36 at the bottom of the drying chamber 28. The particles of the solid amorphous dispersion can be separated from the exhaust gas by means of a cyclone 38 or other storage device. . . . .The choice of sprayed solution and drying conditions must be carried out taking into account the balance of various factors. First the sprayed solution and drying conditions should result in substantially homogeneous solid amorphous dispersions having the physical characteristics described above. Secondly the sprayed solution and drying conditions should also ensure the efficient production of such dispersions in large volumes of sprayed solution. The characteristics of the sprayed solution and the drying conditions necessary to achieve these two goals are described in more detail below. I. I. Spray solution . .The sprayed solution establishes the drug content in the resulting solid amorphous dispersion and also affects the homogeneity of the solid amorphous dispersion and the production efficiency of the dispersion. The spray solution contains at least a drug a polymer and a solvent. 1. 1. The amount of drug and polymer . 0 33 25 . 1 3 .The relative amounts of drug and polymer dissolved in the solvent are selected so that the desired ratio of drug and polymer in the resulting solid amorphous dispersion is obtained at the output. For example if it is desired to obtain a dispersion having a drug polymer ratio of 0.33 25 by weight of the drug in this case the spray solution contains 1 part of the drug and 3 parts of the polymer dissolved in the solvent. . . 5 . 25 . 1 25 . 3 75 . 95 . . 80 . 0 2 30 . . 3 . 5 . 10 . . . 0 5 50000 10 2000 .The total dissolved solids in the sprayed solution is preferably sufficiently high so that spraying the solution leads to efficient production of a solid amorphous dispersion. The total dissolved solids refers to the amount of drug polymer and other excipients dissolved in the solvent. For example for the formation of a spray solution containing 5 wt. The dissolved solid phase and resulting in a solid amorphous dispersion containing 25 wt. Of the drug the spray solution would have to contain 1.25 wt. Of the drug 3.75 wt. polymer and 95 wt. solvent. The drug may be dissolved in a nebulized solution to the solubility limit however the dissolved amount is usually less than 80 of the solubility of the drug in the sprayed solution at the temperature of the solution before spraying. The content of the dissolved solid phase can vary from 0.2 to 30 wt. Depending on the solubility of the drug and polymer in the solvent. For formulations having good solubility in a solvent the dissolved solids content of the sprayed solution is preferably at least 3 wt. More preferably at least 5 wt. And most preferably at least 10 wt. . However the content of the dissolved solid phase should not be too high otherwise the sprayed solution may be too viscous for effective spraying into small droplets. The viscosity of the sprayed solution may vary from about 0.5 to about 50 000 cP and more typically from 10 to 2 000 cP. 2. 2. The choice of solvent . 1 2 3 . .Secondly the solvent is selected so that a substantially homogeneous dispersion with a low residual solvent level is obtained at the outlet. The solvent is selected based on the following characteristics 1 with respect to the solvent both the drug and the polymer are soluble and preferably have high solubility 2 the solvent is relatively volatile and 3 a gelation of the solution occurs during the removal of the solvent. Preferably the solubility of the drug in solution is high enough so that the drug remains soluble in the contained solid phase in which gelation of the solution occurs. a. a. Solubility characteristics . . . 25 C 0 5 . 2 0 . 5 0 . .In order to obtain dispersions that are almost completely amorphous and essentially homogeneous the solvent provides a spray solution in which both the polymer and the drug are both soluble and preferably highly soluble. The drug and polymer should preferably be completely dissolved in the solvent of the spray solution before spraying. This is made possible by thoroughly at the molecular level mixing the polymer drug and solvent. Preferably the solubility of the drug in a solvent at 25 C. is at least 0.5 wt. Preferably at least 2.0 wt. And more preferably at least 5.0 wt. . . . . . . . 20 30 . . . . .The polymer must also be highly soluble in the solvent. However for polymers this is best determined by the nature of the solution formed. Ideally a solvent is selected that dissolves the polymer sufficiently so that the polymer does not strongly aggregate and form an optically transparent solution. Aggregation of a polymer is determined by how much the solution is cloudy or opaque with a high degree of aggregation and by the scattering of the solution by a large amount of light. Thus as is customary in the art the acceptability of a solvent can be determined by measuring the turbidity of the solution or by the level of light scattering. For example acetone is a good solvent of choice for a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate HPMAC polymer forming a clear solution when the polymer is dissolved. On the contrary pure ethanol is an unsuccessful option for HPMCAS in the actual content of the dissolved solid phase since only a small part from about 20 to 30 wt. Of HPMCAS is dissolved in ethanol. The nature of the final heterogeneous mixture obtained using ethanol as a solvent demonstrates this phenomenon a clear solution is located above an opaque solution of a gel like insoluble polymer. Good solubility also leads to another property related to the following namely gelation. With poor solubility of the polymer precipitation occurs mainly separation into a solvent poor solid phase and a polymer poor solution rather than gelation i.e. preservation in the form of a liquid with a high viscosity or a solid single phase polymer and solvent material. . 1 1 1 . . 50 50 . .Solvents suitable for spray drying may be of any composition in which the drug and polymer are mutually soluble. Preferred solvents include alcohols such as methanol ethanol n propanol isopropanol and butanol ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone esters such as ethyl acetate and propyl acetate and various other solvents such as acetonitrile methylene chloride toluene tetrahydrofuran THF cyclic ethers and 1 1 1 trichloroethane. Less volatile solvents such as dimethylacetamide or dimethyl sulfoxide may also be used. Mixtures of solvents such as 50 methanol and 50 acetone and also mixtures with water can also be used provided that the polymer and drug have sufficient solubility so that the spray drying method is feasible. In some cases it may be desirable to add a small amount of water to increase the solubility of the polymer in the spray solution. . b. Boiling point 5 . . 200 C 150 C 100 C. 40 . 100 C . . . 20 C . 56 C 65 C .In order to achieve rapid solvent removal and maintain a low preferably less than about 5 wt. Residual solvent level in the resulting solid amorphous dispersion a relatively volatile solvent is selected. The boiling point of the solvent is preferably lower than about 200 C more preferably lower than about 150 C and more preferably lower than about 100 C. When the solvent is a mixture of solvents up to about 40 of the solvent may contain a non volatile solvent. In such a mixture the boiling point of the other component is preferably low for example below 100 C . The boiling point for solvent mixtures can be determined experimentally. However if the solvent is very volatile it will evaporate very quickly which will lead to the formation of low density particles unless the evaporation stage is carried out at a low temperature. Actions under conditions when the temperature of the exhausted drying gas at the outlet T outlet is lower than about 20 C is often impractical. In fact acetone boiling point 56 C and methanol boiling point 65 C are successfully used for a variety of medicines. . at. Gelation . . . . 1 2 3 . . . .A solvent is selected preferably causing gelation of the sprayed droplets of the drug polymer and solvent prior to solidification during evaporation. The initial spray solution is a homogeneous solution of the dissolved drug and polymer in a solvent. When sprayed into the drying chamber of the sprayed solution it is sprayed onto liquid droplets. Rapid evaporation of the solvent begins from liquid droplets which leads to an increase in the concentration of dissolved drug and polymer in the droplets. As solvent evaporation continues there are three possible scenarios 1 the concentration of the polymer in the droplet exceeds the gel point of the polymer in order to form a homogeneous gel 2 the concentration of the dissolved drug in the droplet exceeds the solubility of the drug in the solution in the droplet causing the phase of the drug to separate in the solution or 3 the concentration of the polymer in the droplet exceeds the solubility of the polymer in the solution in the droplet causing the polymer phase to separate in the solution. The formation of homogeneous solid amorphous dispersions occurs most easily when the solvent and the concentration of the polymer and the drug are selected so that with the evaporation of the solvent the polymer drug and solvent form a homogeneous gel before separation of the drug phase or precipitation of the polymer. On the contrary if the phases of the drug or polymer are separated before gelation of the polymer the choice of spray drying conditions which at the outlet will provide a substantially homogeneous dispersion is complicated. The gelation of the solution that occurs before reaching the solubility limit of the drug greatly slows down the process of separation of the phase of the drug providing adequate time for the solidification of the particles during spray drying without significant phase separation. . . .When choosing a solvent that causes gelation of the polymer the polymer concentration will exceed the gelation point of the polymer since the solvent evaporates from the solvent resulting in a homogeneous gel from the drug polymer and solvent. When this happens the viscosity of the solution in the droplet rises rapidly immobilizing the drug and polymer in the droplet despite the presence of a solvent. With the removal of additional solvent the drug and polymer remain homogeneously distributed throughout the droplet resulting in a substantially homogeneous solid dispersion. . . .Alternatively a solvent and a polymer and such drug concentrations can be selected that with evaporation of the solvent the drug concentration will exceed the solubility of the drug in the solvent i.e. will be supersaturated. In this case the drug has a relatively low solubility in the solvent but the polymer has a high solubility and forms a gel at the dew point. Such a system can produce an acceptable solid amorphous dispersion for example a drug without phase separation such as an amorphous or crystalline drug for the entire period until the time during which the solution has a concentration of the drug above the point where it will eventually become separate from solution phase for example supersaturated but remaining liquid for example not yet hardened is short enough so that the drug is not essentially separated in the form of a phase. 3. 3. Mixing the solution . . . .It is important that the sprayed solution is prepared in such a way that homogeneity of the sprayed solution is achieved in which the entire contained volume of the drug and polymer is completely dissolved. In general the drug and polymer are added to the solvent and mechanically mixed or shaken for some time. Examples of mixing methods include immersion blades or mixers. The solution is preferably mixed for a relatively long period of time such as four to eight hours ensuring that all of the polymer and drug are dissolved. . 100 . . . . . . . .In preferred embodiments the drug and polymer are mixed with the solvent using a separate mixing device such as a high shear powder dispersant a jet mixer or a linear mixer. The authors of the present invention revealed that the inability of the polymer to completely dissolve in a solvent in an acceptable period of time is a problem that can lead to the formation of large batches of sprayed solution more than about 100 liters . If the polymer powder is not sufficiently dispersed or if it is added too quickly to the solvent the polymer may form lumps and begin to dissolve. The solvent will begin to dissolve the outer layer of the polymer forming a gel. After the formation of the outer gel layer the penetration of the solvent through the gel layer into the inner layers of the dry polymer becomes more difficult. Such partially dissolved lumps may interfere with the spray drying process for example causing clogging of the spray gun. In addition inhomogeneous particles having a substantially higher drug content with respect to the polymer than desired and some particles having a lower drug content with respect to the polymer than is desired may be released from such lumps. In extreme cases some particles may even consist mainly of polymer. To eliminate this problem the polymer can be mixed with the drug separately from the reservoir containing the spray solution for example using a powder dispersant with high shear. . 2 18 40 42 44. 18 40 44. 42 44. 44 18.

East Longmeadow MA LIGHTNIN Rochester NH and EKATO Corporation Ramsey NJ. II. II. Solvent evaporation 1. 1. Process conditions . . . . . .The method of evaporation of the solvent from the sprayed solution also affects the density and particle size of the solid amorphous dispersion as well as the homogeneity of the solid amorphous dispersion. The problem with solvent removal is that factors that usually facilitate the formation of homogeneous particles often lead to the formation of particles having an undesirably low density and vice versa. For the formation of a substantially amorphous homogeneous dispersion rapid removal of the solvent is desirable. Since the sprayed solution is a homogeneous mixture of the drug polymer and solvent the solvent must be removed in a short time interval relative to the time required to separate the drug and polymer from each other. On the other hand the formation of dense particles requires slow removal of the solvent. However this can lead to the production of particles that are inhomogeneous and or have undesirably high residual levels of solvent. 10 . . 0 1 . 10 . 100 20 1 .Typically the solvent evaporates quickly enough so that when the droplets reach the outlet of the drying chamber they are essentially solid and have a residual solvent content of less than 10 wt. . A large surface to volume ratio of the droplets and a large driving force for the evaporation of the solvent lead to the fact that the actual drying time is several seconds or less and more typically less than 0.1 seconds. Drying periods in case the residual solvent level is less than 10 wt. Should be less than 100 seconds preferably less than 20 seconds and more preferably less than 1 second. . . 10 . 5 . 3 . . T 20 C . 40 C 20 C 40 C.In addition the final solvent content of the solid dispersion should be low after it leaves the drying chamber since the residual solvent of the dispersion reduces T from the dispersion. Thus it is necessary to select drying conditions resulting in low residual solvent levels so that the glass transition temperature of the dispersion at its outlet from the drying chamber is high. Typically the solvent content of the amorphous dispersion at the outlet of the drying chamber should be less than about 10 wt. Preferably less than about 5 wt. And more preferably less than about 3 wt. . The residual solvent level is preferably low enough so that T with a solid amorphous dispersion is at least 20 C lower than the temperature of the exhaust drying gas at the outlet T outlet and more preferably at least equal to the T outlet . For example if the drying gas outlet has a temperature of 40 C then T with a solid amorphous dispersion with a residual solvent level at the outlet of the drying chamber preferably is at least 20 C and more preferably at least 40 C. . . . . 20 C 0 C. . . .This highlights another potential perspective. In general it is generally accepted that low residual levels of solvent are achieved by increasing the temperature of the drying gas T inlet which in turn leads to higher values of T output . The present inventors circumvent this problem by using a relatively high drying gas flow rate relative to the spray solution flow rate at a relatively low inlet temperature T inlet . This leads to the desired result to achieve a relatively low T yield while still achieving a low residual solvent level. This set of process conditions generally leads to the desired goal of maintaining the T yield of T with below 20 C and preferably below 0 C. In practice as described above the flow rate of the drying gas is set within a relatively narrow range. Thus for this installation a high ratio of the drying gas flow rate to the spray solution flow rate is maintained by reducing the spray solution flow rate as well as the T inlet to maintain a low T output . This is a difference from the conventional method of spray drying since in this way the productivity of the installation is reduced kg of product hour . 80 . . . 1 0 01 0 50 2 3 . .Since the spray solution may consist of a solvent of 80 wt. Or more substantial amounts of solvent must be removed during the evaporation process. A large driving force for solvent evaporation is usually provided by maintaining the partial pressure of the solvent in the drying chamber well below the vapor pressure of the solvent at the temperature of the droplets being dried. This is achieved as 1 by maintaining a partial vacuum in the drying chamber with pressure for example from 0.01 to 0.50 bar and 2 mixing liquid droplets of the sprayed solution with a warm drying gas or 3 with both. In addition part of the heat required to evaporate the solvent can also be provided by heating the spray solution. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 .Several parameters affect the rate and degree of solvent evaporation from sprayed droplets and the characteristics of the resulting particles of a solid amorphous dispersion 1 pressure in the drying chamber 2 drying gas feed rate 3 a drying gas composition 4 the temperature of the sprayed solution 5 the temperature of the drying gas at the inlet T inlet 6 the feed rate of the spray solution and 7 the droplet size when spraying the spray solution. . . . 1 . PSD 2 NIRO Niro A S 1 017 1 033 1 022 1 032 . . .The pressure in the drying chamber and the feed rate of the drying gas within a relatively narrow operating range are usually determined by the specific configuration of the drying chamber and the combined product collectors such as cyclones dust collectors etc. . Within the spray dryer a positive pressure is usually maintained relative to the ambient pressure for example higher than 1 bar . For example for a PSD 2 NIRO spray dryer Niro A S Copenhagen Denmark the pressure in the chamber can vary from 1.017 to 1.033 bar preferably from 1.022 to 1.032 bar. The need to maintain a positive pressure in the chamber is partially due to safety considerations since this reduces the likelihood of air entering the drying chamber and therefore minimizes the effect of oxygen on the evaporated solvent. In addition product manifolds such as a cyclone usually operate more efficiently at positive pressures. . . . . 10 . 10 . . . . . .The drying gas entering the spray chamber must have a sufficiently high flow rate to absorb the evaporating solvent entering the chamber as the solvent of the spray solution. This ensures a sufficiently dry environment allowing evaporation in cool conditions. To achieve low residual solvent levels the dew point of the solvent in the drying gas in the drying chamber must be low. The solvent vapor content in the drying gas which determines the dew point should be less than the amount of solvent vapor in equilibrium with the solid amorphous dispersion having the desired residual solvent content. For example if it is desired that the solid amorphous dispersion exiting the drying chamber have a residual solvent content of 10 wt or less the maximum content of solvent vapor in the drying gas in the drying chamber should be less than the content of solvent vapor that is present in the gas equilibrium with a solid amorphous dispersion having 10 wt. residual solvent at a temperature T output . The maximum solvent vapor content that can be present in the drying chamber can be calculated or experimentally determined for any given desired residual solvent level. In an experimental determination a solid amorphous dispersion can be placed in a sealed container with dehydrated gas. Possible addition of solvent vapor. From time to time an analysis of the solid amorphous dispersion can be performed to determine the residual solvent content that is in equilibrium with the solvent vapor. . 10 C 20 C 30 C. 40 C 5 5 C. . 50 80 400 600 3 . 400 500 2000 2500 3 . . 4 3 4 5 3 .In practice the need for dehydration of the drying gas leads to very low dew points of the solvent in the drying gas. The dew point of the solvent in the drying chamber when the solvent is completely evaporated should be significantly lower than the T yield and may be lower than the T yield at least 10 C at least 20 C or even at least 30 C. For example when spray drying with acetone as a solvent at an outlet temperature T of the outlet equal to 40 C the drying gas flow rate can be set such that the dew point of acetone in the drying chamber is in the range from 5 to 5 C. Such a dehydrated drying gas provides a high driving force for rapid evaporation even under relatively cool conditions. When the feed rate of the sprayed solution is from 50 to about 80 kg h the feed rate of the drying gas can vary from about 400 to about 600 m 3 h. At a high feed rate of the sprayed solution for example at a feed rate of from about 400 to 500 kg h the feed rate of drying gas can vary from about 2000 to about 2500 m 3 h. This leads to relatively high ratios of the flow rate of the drying gas and the feed rate of the sprayed solution. This ratio is preferably at least 4 m 3 h and more preferably at least 4.5 m 3 h. . . . 1 46 48 . 46 .The drying gas may in fact be any gas but an inert gas such as nitrogen nitrogen enriched air or argon is used to minimize the risk of fire or explosion due to the ignition of flammable vapors and to minimize the undesired oxidation of the drug increase the concentration of polymer or other materials in the dispersion. In addition the drying gas entering the drying chamber may contain a small amount of solvent in vapor form at the inlet. Referring back to FIG. 1 a spray drying apparatus may include a drying gas recirculation system 46 which further comprises a solvent recovery system 48. As described in more detail below with respect to the drying gas recirculation system 46 the amount of solvent vapor in the drying gas affects the evaporation rate of the solvent from the droplets and thus the particle density. . 0 50 C . . . .The temperature of the sprayed solution is usually determined in accordance with the solubility characteristics and stability of the components of the sprayed solution. In general the sprayed solution can be stored at a temperature in the range of 0 to 50 C and is usually stored at a temperature close to room temperature. You can increase the temperature to improve solubility in the solution of the drug or polymer. In addition an elevated temperature of the sprayed solution can be set to provide auxiliary heating of the drying process in order to further increase the rate of evaporation of the solvent from the droplets. Also if necessary the temperature can be lowered to increase the stability of the drug in the spray solution. T . . T 5 150 C . 56 C T 60 200 C 1 035 . T 80 C 90 C 100 C.The temperature of the drying gas at the inlet to the chamber is set aforementioned as T inlet so that the solvent evaporates from the droplets of the sprayed solution but at the same time the temperature is controlled to maintain a relatively cool environment in the drying chamber. In order to provide energy for the evaporation of the solvent entering the drying chamber the drying gas is usually heated. In general the drying gas can be heated to an inlet temperature T which is above the boiling point of the solvent and is in the range of about 5 to about 150 C. above the boiling point of the solvent. For example when using a solvent of acetone for spray drying the boiling point of which under ambient environmental conditions is 56 C the characteristic temperature range for the T inlet is from 60 to 200 C at an operating pressure in the drying chamber of about 1.035 bar. In practice the temperature T of the inlet of the drying gas entering the dryer inlet may be higher than 80 C may be higher than 90 C and may be higher than 100 C. T . T . T . T . T . T 200 C 150 C. T 90 150 C 100 130 C.There are a number of limitations on the maximum values of T inlet these are the thermal properties of the spray dried solid amorphous dispersion. The inlet T should be low enough so that solid amorphous dispersion particles that are in close proximity to the inlet of the drying gas do not decompose. In general the T input is maintained below the melting point of the solid amorphous dispersion. Preferred maximum input T values can be determined by heating the solid amorphous dispersion and determining the decomposition temperature of the solid amorphous dispersion for example when discoloration or its stickiness or tackiness appear. The input T is preferably maintained below the temperature at which any of these conditions occurs. Typically the inlet T is less than 200 C and preferably less than 150 C. In one embodiment the inlet T ranges from 90 to 150 C preferably from 100 to 130 C. T . Niro PSD 2 10 65 50 75 . . 50 100 200 400 . 400 600 .The feed rate of the sprayed solution will depend on a variety of factors such as the temperature of the drying gas at the inlet T inlet the flow rate of the drying gas the size of the drying chamber and spray. In practice the feed rate of the sprayed solution by spray drying using a Niro PSD 2 spray dryer can range from 10 to 65 kg h more preferably from 50 to 75 kg h. A particular utility of the present invention is to increase the feed rate of the sprayed solution which allows to increase the amount of product in production. In preferred embodiments the feed rate of the spray solution is at least 50 kg h preferably 100 kg h more preferably at least 200 kg h and most preferably at least 400 kg h. In one embodiment the feed rate of the sprayed solution may vary from 400 to 600 kg h. T . T . . T .To achieve the efficiency of spray drying high yield of the finished product and high quality characteristics of the particles the feed rate of the sprayed solution is controlled together with T inlet . Suitable ranges of the feed rate of the spray solution and T inputs can be determined by the thermodynamics of the drying process which is easily quantifiable. The heat content and flow rate of the heated drying gas are known the heat content the heat of vaporization and the flow rate of the sprayed solution are known and the heat loss from the drying chamber to the environment is measurable. Therefore the energy and mass balances of the incoming flows spray solution and drying gas make it possible to give a preliminary assessment of the state of the process at the outlet namely an estimate of the exit temperature of the drying gas at the outlet of the drying chamber referred to as T outlet and the concentration of solvent vapor in the drying gas in the drying the camera. . . 3 Niro PSD 2. 16 . 84 . 530 3 .

FIG. 3 is an example of an isothermal diagram for an experimental scale spray dryer Niro PSD 2. This chart is for a sprayable solution containing 16 wt. Solid phase and 84 wt. Acetone and for a flow rate of drying gas of 530 m 3 h. The horizontal axis shows the inlet temperature of the drying gas T inlet from 60 C to a maximum of 180 C. The vertical axis shows the feed rate of the sprayed solution in kg h. The solid diagonal lines show the constant dew point T of the dew of the drying gas at the outlet T of the outlet . The dotted diagonal lines show the constant dew point T of the dew of the solvent in the drying gas. Charts of this type can be used to determine the potential productivity of a given drying chamber for a given spray solution. In addition isothermal diagrams can be used to determine ranges of operating conditions for the production of a solid amorphous dispersion with the desired qualities. . 3 . T . T . . . T . 20 30 C T .Returning now in more detail to FIG. 3 it is possible to observe the relationship of various operating conditions and the resulting solid amorphous dispersion. One of the limitations of the spray drying method is the ratio between the dew point of the solvent vapor in the drying gas and the T output . As soon as the dew point of the solvent vapor of the drying gas exceeds the T outlet the drying gas in the drying chamber is saturated in solvent vapor and it becomes impossible to completely dry the solid amorphous dispersion. In fact even approaching this limit leads to significant amounts of spray solution breaking on the walls of the drying chamber due to insufficient drying time and or distance. This area in the diagram is labeled as the area of Residual Solvent Compounding Product Reduction. Thus spray conditions should be selected so as to maintain the dew point substantially below the T outlet . Preferably the dew point is set at least 20 30 C lower than the T outlet . T . T . T . . . . T . . 3 30 C. T 50 C. T T 20 C T 20 C T .Another limitation of the spray drying method is the ratio between the T yield and the melting and glass transition temperatures of the resulting solid amorphous dispersion particles. If the T output is higher than the melting point then the particles of the solid amorphous dispersion may melt upon contact with the walls of the drying chamber which leads to a decrease in production. In addition it is also preferable to maintain the T yield below the glass transition temperature of the solid amorphous dispersion. As described above drug mobility in a solid amorphous dispersion is a function of the glass transition temperature of the solid amorphous dispersion. When the temperature of the solid amorphous dispersion is lower than its glass transition temperature the mobility of the drug is low and the drug remains homogeneously dispersed in an amorphous state throughout the polymer. However if a solid amorphous dispersion is exposed to temperatures higher than its glass transition temperature for a prolonged period of time and a high mobility of the drug is observed during this period of time the drug in the dispersion can phase out and may eventually crystallize. Thus a substantially homogeneous substantially amorphous dispersion is most likely to be obtained when the T output is maintained below the glass transition temperature of the solid amorphous dispersion. Returning to FIG. 3 the glass transition temperature of the solid amorphous dispersion is about 30 C. Thus it is most likely that the inhomogeneous product is obtained in the region below the diagonal line representing the T output of 50 C. Preferably there is a yield T lower than T c of the solid amorphous dispersion particle plus 20 C T s 20 C and preferably less than T s . 50 . T . T . . . . . T . T . . 3 T 10 C . T 5 25 C 10 20 C .In addition the authors of the present invention revealed that for a solid amorphous dispersion containing at least about 50 wt. Polymer the T yield generally indicates its density and the content of residual solvent in the solid amorphous dispersion. The authors of the present invention revealed that with increasing T output the particle density decreases. Not intending to confine themselves to any particular theory the authors of the present invention believe that at high drying temperatures the droplets quickly form a dry outer skin . This skin creates a surface area of the particle. When the temperature inside the droplet is high the droplet dries in the form of a hollow sphere which leads to a low density. At lower temperatures the droplet does not form a dry skin so quickly and it then falls off during evaporation forming denser particles. The result of lowering the temperature inside the drying chamber displayed in a lower T output is a slower drying and higher product density. However if the T yield is too low the residual solvent level in the solid amorphous dispersion will be too high. Returning again to FIG. 3 the region located above the output value T above 10 C marked as region Low generation of the due to increasing residual solvent in the hard amorphous dispersion. In general it is desirable to maintain the yield T above the dew point of the solvent and below the boiling point of the solvent and preferably from about 5 to about 25 C below the boiling point of the solvent and more preferably from about 10 to about 20 C below the boiling point of the solvent. .

T .In practice the feed rate of the drying gas the pressure in the chamber and the heating of the sprayed solution are usually set within narrow ranges. Accordingly the feed rate of the sprayed solution and the temperature of the drying gas T inlet are adjusted so as to obtain as described above a satisfactory T outlet . Returning again to FIG. 3 the optimum working area for the dryer shown in FIG. 3 is a region in the form of a diagonal strip between the isotherms T of the outlet at 50 and 30 C. Therefore the T inlet and the feed rate of the sprayed solution are adjusted so as to achieve a T outlet within this band. In order to maximize the heat capacity of the drying chamber the expected conditions with a high temperature at the inlet T of the inlet and a high feed rate of the sprayed solution which are located in the corner of the strip are selected for operation. However with an increase in the ratio of the feed rate of the drying gas and the sprayed solution the particle density often increases. Thus for a given T output it may be preferable to work in a lower region in the left corner of the strip i.e. at a lower feed rate of the sprayed solution and lower T input even though the optimal performance of the solution through the drying chamber is not is achieved. This leads to a decrease in T dew and thus to dehydration drying gas. in FIG. 3 work in a state where T dew point is between 5 and 5 C the hard amorphous produces a homogeneous dispersion which is dense specific for cm 10 cm 3 g and a low level of residual solvent 10 wt. . Furthermore as noted above T input can also be reduced if the reduced accumulation of hard amorphous dispersion in the drying chamber due to local melting charring or burning the spray drying product on any excessively hot surface in the drying chamber. 2. 2. Spray Drying Equipment a. a. Spray . . 500 300 . 1 500 5 200 . . . .To form small droplets a spray solution is supplied through the spray gun to the drying chamber. The formation of small droplets leads to a high ratio of surface area to volume thereby facilitating the evaporation of the solvent. In general to achieve rapid evaporation of the solvent the size of the droplets formed by the spray drying method is preferably less than about 500 microns in diameter and preferably less than about 300 microns. Typically the droplet size varies from 1 to 500 microns in diameter and the most typical sizes are from 5 to 200 microns. Examples of nebulizers include high pressure nozzles centrifugal nebulizers and air nebulizers. When selecting a nebulizer used to form a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion several factors must be considered including the desired feed rate of the sprayed solution the maximum allowable fluid pressure and viscosity and surface tension of the sprayed solution. The relationship between these factors and their effect on droplet size and droplet size distribution are well known to those skilled in the art. . 10 10 1 . 10 100 . 400 PSD 1 . . . . . . . . .In a preferred embodiment the atomizer is a high pressure nozzle. A high pressure nozzle is defined as a nebulizer that produces droplets with an average diameter of 10 m or more while containing less than about 10 of the volume of droplets having a size less than about 1 m. In general a nozzle that produces droplets in the range from 10 to 100 m when pumping the sprayed solution through the nozzle at the desired speed is considered to be the appropriate size and intended high pressure nozzle. Thus for example if it is desired to provide a spray solution at a rate of 400 g min to the PSD 1 dryer to achieve the desired average droplet size it is necessary to select a nozzle corresponding to the viscosity and flow rate of the solution. When operating at the desired flow rate an overly large nozzle will produce droplets that are too large. This is especially confirmed with a higher viscosity of the sprayed solution since the viscosity of the solution directly affects the operation of the sprayer. At a constant flow rate of the sprayed solution with increasing viscosity the droplet size increases and the nozzle pressure decreases. As a result droplets that are too large have a very low drying rate which can result in an inhomogeneous dispersion or if droplets reaching the spray dryer wall are still liquid they can stick or even cover the dryer wall and as a result the production of the desired product will be low or will be absent. In such cases it is possible to increase the height of the chamber of the spray dryer to provide an increase in the minimum distance that the droplet passes before it hits the wall of the drying chamber or the storage cone. Such a modified spray drying apparatus which allows the use of spray means that large droplets are produced. The following describes in detail such a modified spray drying apparatus. Using a nozzle too small may produce undesirably small droplets or may require the use of unacceptably high pump pressures to achieve the desired flow rate in particular for supplying high viscosity solutions. . . 4. 50 52 28. . 4 54 56 58 60 62 . . 5 62 . 64 62 52 . 66 52.

The high pressure nozzle may be a high pressure vortex nozzle well known in the art. High pressure nozzles such as those shown in FIG. 4 and 5 include a vortex chamber which creates a hollow cone from the sprayed solution in the form of a film or a sheet of solution breaking into a droplet cloud in the form of a hollow cone. . .

Lefebvre Atomization and Sprays 1989 .The vast majority of nebulizers spray the spray solution into droplets with a size distribution. The size distribution of the droplets produced by the atomizer can be measured using a number of technologies including mechanical technologies such as the technology of molten paraffin and frozen droplets electrical technologies such as electrode wire and hot wire technology and optical technologies such as photography and light scattering. Examples of devices that determine the size distribution of atomizer droplets produced include the Malvern Particle Size Analyzer available from Malvern Instruments Ltd. of Framingham Massachusetts and the Doppler Particle Analyzer available from TSI Inc .

One of them is D 10 this is the diameter corresponding to the diameter of the droplets which make up 10 of the total liquid volume containing droplets of equal or smaller diameter. In other words if D 10 is 1 m 10 of the droplet volume have a diameter equal to or less than 1 m. Thus it is preferable that the spraying mechanisms produce droplets whose diameter D 10 is greater than about 1 m and means that the diameter of 90 of the droplet volume is greater than 1 m. This requirement guarantees the presence in the hardened product of a minimum amount of dust fraction i.e. particles with a diameter of less than 1 m . Preferably D 10 is greater than about 10 microns and more preferably greater than about 15 microns. D90 90 . D90 100 90 100 . D90 300 250 . D90 .Another useful characteristic diameter of the droplets produced by the spraying mechanisms is D 90 which is the diameter corresponding to the diameter of the droplets which comprise 90 of the total liquid volume containing droplets of equal or smaller diameter. In other words if D 90 is 100 m 90 of the droplet volume has a diameter less than or equal to 100 m. For the production of a substantially homogeneous substantially amorphous dispersion using the technology of the present invention D 90 should preferably be less than about 300 microns more preferably less than 250 microns. If D 90 is too large the drying rate of large droplets may be very slow which may result in an inhomogeneous dispersion or if large droplets reaching the walls of the spray dryer still remain liquid they may adhere or even cover the wall of the dryer as noted above. Another useful parameter is Interval defined by the formula D50 50 D90 D10 . . . 3 2 1 5.where D 50 is the diameter corresponding to the diameter of the droplets which are 50 of the total liquid volume containing droplets of equal or smaller diameter and D 90 and D 10 are defined as described above. The interval sometimes referred to in the art as the Relative Interval Factor or OFI is a dimensionless parameter indicating uniformity of droplet size distribution. In general the lower the Interval the narrower the size distribution of droplets produced by spraying mechanisms which in turn usually leads to a narrower particle size distribution for dried particles which leads to improved flow characteristics. Preferably the interval of the droplets produced by the nebulizer is less than about 3 more preferably less than about 2 and most preferably less than about 1.5. . 80 . .The particle size of the solid amorphous dispersion formed in the drying chamber is generally somewhat smaller than the size of the droplets produced by the atomizer. As a rule the characteristic particle diameter of a solid amorphous dispersion is about 80 of the characteristic diameter of the droplets. Due to the unsatisfactory flow characteristics it is desirable to avoid small particle sizes of the amorphous dispersion therefore a nozzle is usually selected that produces droplets of the largest sizes that can be adequately dried in a spray drying plant. .

The required pressure is determined in accordance with the design of the spray nozzle orifice viscosity and other characteristics of the supplied solvent stream and in accordance with the desired droplet size and size distribution. In general the supply pressure should be in the range of 1 to 500 bar or higher with the most characteristic pressure of 2 to 100 bar. For a PSD 2 spray dryer using a high pressure nozzle as a spray gun the nozzle pressure can be from 40 to 55 bar at a flow rate of from 50 to about 90 kg h. For a spray dryer PSD 5 using a high pressure nozzle as a spray gun the nozzle pressure can be from 140 to 210 bar at a flow rate of from about 400 to about 500 kg h. . . . 1 26 VED Bran Leubbe GmbH Norderstedt Germany.When using a high pressure nozzle the pump directing the sprayed solution to the sprayer should be able to generate adequate pressure at the desired feed rate and low pulsation.

With reference to FIG. 1 pump 26 may be a VED displacement diaphragm pump available from Bran Leubbe GmbH Norderstedt Germany. . b. Gas dispersant . . .The spray drying apparatus also includes a gas dispersant for mixing the drying gas with droplets. The design of the gas dispersant provides that the newly introduced drying gas is adequately mixed with the spray droplets to be sprayed so that all droplets are dried quickly enough to minimize product build up in the spray chamber and on the spray. Therefore the gas dispersant is designed in the form of a spray atomizer taking into account the flow rate of the drying gas and the overall dimensions of the drying chamber. . 1 32. . 6 100 102 100 104 . 108 110 112. 102 100 106 . 6. 60 354080 2 2002 PC23195 . DPH Niro Inc. Columbia Maryland.In FIG. 1 schematically shows a gas dispersant 32. In FIG. 6 is a schematic cross sectional view of a drying chamber 100 which includes a gas dispersion device 102 located inside the drying chamber 100 and below the cover 104 of the drying chamber. The drying gas enters the chamber 108 and passes through the openings 110 in the plate 112. The gas dispersion device 102 allows the drying gas to pass into the chamber 100 so that the initial flow is generally parallel to the axis of the diffuser 106 and is distributed relatively evenly across the width of the diameter of the device as schematically shown by down arrows at the top of FIG. 6. A detailed description of such a gas dispersant is given more fully in US Pat.

Columbia Maryland. . at. Drying chamber . . 7 140 142. .The size and shape of the drying chamber are designed in such a way as to allow sufficient evaporation of the droplets of the sprayed solution before breaking them on any surface of the chamber and allow efficient accumulation of the product. Turning to FIG. 7 typically the drying chamber has an upper cylindrical part 140 and a lower storage cone 142. The distance between the spray gun and the inner surfaces of the drying chamber generally limits the size of droplets that can evaporate and in turn the number of product particles that can be formed without excessive buildup of material along the side walls of the storage cone and the drying chamber. 140 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . 500 3 1 . . . 6 60 354080.The height H of the upper cylindrical part 140 of the drying chamber should be large enough to allow atomized droplets sufficient time for evaporation before breaking up onto the lower part of the drying chamber. The height H of the upper part of the drying chamber which provides a sufficient minimum distance that a droplet passes before hitting the wall of the drying chamber or the storage cone is a function of several factors including 1 drying characteristics of the solvent feed 2 the flow rates solvent and drying gas in the spray dryer 3 inlet gas temperature 4 droplet size and size distribution of droplets 5 average time of presence of material in the spray dryer 6 a gas circulation system in the drying chamber and 7 a spray system. In general for drying gas streams of 500 m 3 h a height H greater than about 1 m is preferred. The height will partially depend on the particular choice of gas dispersant. For the gas dispersant shown in FIG. 6 a higher height H is desirable as described in more detail in U.S. Patent Application Loan Transfer Serial Number 60 354080. . . . . . . .Despite the fact that the height of the drying chamber is also a decisive factor determining the minimum distance that a droplet passes before it hits the wall of the drying chamber the volume of the drying chamber is also important. The capacity of the spray dryer is partially determined by the correspondence of the feed rate of the sprayed solution to the temperature and the flow rate of the drying gas. As described above the temperature and flow rate of the drying gas must be sufficiently high so that enough heat is supplied to the spray drying unit to evaporate the spray solution. Thus with an increase in the feed rate of the sprayed solution the flow rate and or temperature of the drying gas must be increased in order to provide sufficient energy to form the desired product. Since the permissible temperature of the drying gas is often limited by the chemical stability of the drug present in the sprayed solution the flow rate of the drying gas is often increased which allows to increase the capacity i.e. to increase the feed rate of the sprayed solution in the spray drying unit. For a drying chamber with a given volume an increase in the flow rate of the drying gas will reduce the average residence time of the droplets or particles in the dryer which could lead to a lack of time for evaporation of the solvent from the droplets so that a solid particle forms before breaking on the surface of the drying chamber even at that the height of the drying chamber is greater than the height of a conventional dryer. As a result the volume of the dryer must be large enough so that the droplet is sufficiently dried by the time of breaking on the inner surface of the drying chamber to prevent buildup of material. You can take this drying time for the average residence time defined as the ratio of the volume of the drying chamber to the volumetric flow rate of the drying gas supplied to the drying unit or V G . 110 112. D L V where V dryers is the volume of the drying chamber and G is the volumetric flow rate of the drying gas supplied to the drying chamber. The volume of the drying chamber is the sum of the volumes of the upper part 110 of the drying chamber and the storage cone 112. For a cylindrical spray drying installation with a diameter D a height H of the drying chamber and a height L of the storage cone the volume of the dryer V of the dryer will be set as 10 15 20 .The inventors have determined that the average residence time should be at least 10 seconds which ensures that the droplets have sufficient time to dry before breaking on the surface inside the spray dryer more preferably the average residence time is at least 15 seconds and most preferably at least 20 seconds. 0 25 3 20 For example for a volumetric flow rate of a drying gas of 0.25 m 3 s and an average residence time of 20 seconds the required volume of a spray drying plant can be calculated as follows 5 3 H 2 3 112 114 60 L 112 D L D D Thus for a spray dryer with a volume of 5 m 3 a height H of 2.3 m and a storage cone 112 with a cone angle of 114 equal to 60 meaning that the height L of the storage cone 112 is equal to the diameter D of the drying chamber or L D the required diameter D of the spray dryer chamber can be calculated from the above equation as follows D 1 5 or D 1.5 m 1 5 20 .By providing a diameter of the drying chamber of at least 1.5 m the average residence time of the particles in the dryer will be at least 20 seconds and the droplets produced by the atomizer can be sufficiently dry by the time they break on the surface of the dryer to minimize material buildup over the walls of the drying chamber and the storage cone at a given suitable height and diameter spray characteristics and gas flow characteristics. 140 D . 2 6 D 1 2 2 6 1 2 2 2. 0 9 2 5.

For example if the drying chamber has a height H of 2.6 m and a diameter D of 1.2 m the drying chamber has an aspect ratio of 2.6 1.2 2.2. In general the aspect ratio of the drying chamber may vary from about 0.9 to about 2.5. For the DPH gas dispersant available from Niro Inc the effective aspect ratio is from about 1 to 1.2 while for the gas dispersant shown in FIG. 6 a higher aspect ratio up to about 2 or more is desired. To achieve effective product accumulation a certain angle of the cone 114 of the storage cone is selected. The angle of the cone 114 may vary from about 30 to about 70 preferably from 40 to about 60 . 10 90 2 6 1 2 2 2 60 L 1 3 30 35 400 550 . 400 500 2 7 D 2 6 1 40 L 3 7 30 35 2000 2500 3 .In one embodiment a drying chamber capable of delivering a spray solution at a rate of from 10 to about 90 kg h has a height H of about 2.6 m a diameter of about 1.2 m an aspect ratio of 2.2 a cone angle of about 60 a cone height L of about 1.3 m and a gas residence time of about 30 to 35 seconds at a gas flow rate of from about 400 to about 550 kg h. In another embodiment a drying chamber capable of delivering a spray solution at a rate of from 400 to about 500 kg h has a height H of about 2.7 m a diameter of D of about 2.6 m an aspect ratio of about 1 a cone angle of about 40 a cone height L of about 3.7 m and a gas residence time of about 30 to 35 seconds at a gas flow rate of from about 2000 to about 2500 m 3 h. . at.

Examples of product collectors include cyclones dust collectors and dust collectors. For example in the system shown in FIG. 1 cyclone 38 accumulates most particles of a solid amorphous dispersion. Particles of the solid amorphous dispersion are removed from the cyclone 38 through the paired valves 120 and 122 and accumulate in a container 124 such as a drum. The cyclone 38 may include a vibrator not shown or other mechanical device for agitating particles inside the cyclone 38 which as is known in the art improves the efficiency of material transfer from the cyclone 38. The spent drying gas exits the cyclone 38 and passes through the dust collector a chamber 126 that collects small dust particles that bypass the cyclone 38. .

Returning to FIG. 1 the spray drying system may optionally include a drying gas recirculation system 46 which forms a closed loop from the outlet 36 of the drying chamber to the inlet 32 of the drying chamber for recirculating the drying gas. The drying gas recirculation system includes a blower 128 located downstream of the dust chamber 126 to direct the drying gas to the solvent recovery system 48. Examples of solvent recovery systems include condensers wet scrubbers semi permeable membranes adsorption biological scrubbers adsorption and irrigated bed reactors. As shown in FIG. 1 the solvent recovery system is a condenser 130. The condenser 130 cools the drying gas to remove the solvent. Then the drying gas enters the working heater 132 where the drying gas is heated until the desired inlet temperature T of the inlet is reached. Then another blower 134 directs the drying gas to the gas dispersant 32 so that the drying gas can enter the drying chamber 28 through the inlet 34. The recirculation loop 46 also includes an outlet 136 allowing the recirculated drying gas to be discharged and an inlet 138 allowing the drying gas to be added. to the recirculation loop. 48 130 Atlas Industrial Manufacturing Clifton New Jersey . 30 15 C . 30 0 C 25 5 C. . 5 50 . 15 30 . . 20 25 C 5 20 C. In solvent removal system 48 condenser 130 is a shell and tube heat exchanger available from various manufacturers such as Atlas Industrial Manufacturing Clifton New Jersey . Typical condenser exit temperatures range from about 30 to about 15 C and will depend on the freezing point of the solvent. For example when acetone is used as a solvent the exit temperature from the condenser varies from 30 to 0 C preferably from 25 to 5 C. Typically the condenser operates at such an exit temperature that the condenser removes only part of the solvent vapor from the drying gas. For example when using an acetone solvent it is possible to set the temperature of the condenser such that the drying gas leaving the condenser has a relative concentration of acetone vapor from about 5 to 50 wt. More preferably from about 15 to 30 wt. . Alternatively the dew point of acetone in the drying gas at the outlet of the condenser may range from about 20 to about 25 C more preferably from about 5 to about 20 C. . . . 5 50 . .The inventors have found that maintaining a small amount of residual solvent vapor in the drying gas can improve the physical properties of the dispersion obtained by spray drying. This was an unexpected result since the generally accepted view was that the drying gas should be as dry as possible to achieve rapid evaporation of the solvent. In particular the use of a drying gas containing a small amount of solvent can reduce the residual solvent content and the specific volume of particles of a solid amorphous dispersion exiting the drying chamber in the production of a homogeneous solid amorphous dispersion. Preferably the amount of solvent vapor in the drying gas ranges from 5 to about 50 wt. . . . 1 . 5 5 C . .On the other hand since the amount of solvent vapor in the drying gas is a function of the efficiency of the solvent removal system the solvent removal system can operate in such a way that a small amount of solvent together with the recirculated drying gas is allowed to enter the solvent removal system. For example for the drying gas recirculation system shown in FIG. 1 the condenser can operate at a temperature allowing a small amount of solvent vapor to pass through the condenser. The exit temperature from the condenser is from about 5 to about 5 C. for an acetone based spray solution which leads to a sufficient amount of solvent vapor in the drying gas. However care must be taken not to introduce too many solvent vapors into the drying gas since with a higher content of solvent vapors in the drying gas the content of residual solvent in the solid amorphous dispersion begins to increase which is associated with less efficient drying of the droplets and ultimately with the absence of drying in case the drying gas is saturated with solvent vapor. . . . .Not intending to limit themselves to any theory the authors of the present invention believe that the presence of a small amount of solvent vapor in the drying gas can one or both of the following effects improve drying. Firstly solvent vapors in the drying gas can cause more uniform drying of the droplets of the sprayed solution by delaying the formation of the skin as indicated above . Secondly solvent vapors due to their greater heat capacity than that of the drying gas can provide more heat energy to the drying chamber at a given temperature and flow of drying gas compared to the same flow of dry drying gas at the same temperature. In any case adding a small amount of solvent vapor to the drying gas reduces the residual solvent content and decreases the specific volume of the solid amorphous dispersion particles leaving the drying chamber. Medicine . . .The term drug is generally accepted and refers to a composition having useful prophylactic and or therapeutic properties when administered to an animal especially a human. In order to benefit from the present invention the drug should not be a drug with low solubility although sparingly soluble preparations are preferred for use in the present invention. Even when the drug nevertheless exhibits significant solubility in the desired environment of use with the present invention it will be possible to obtain benefits associated with an increase in solubility bioavailability if there is a reduction in the size of the dose necessary for therapeutic efficacy or an increase in the rate of absorption of the drug in cases when a rapid onset of drug action is desired. 0 01 pH pH 1 8 1 2 1 20 40 . . 10 1 0 1 . 10 100 pH 1 8 USP . .A preferred drug is a sparingly soluble drug meaning that the drug can be either substantially insoluble in water which means that the drug has a minimum solubility in water of less than 0.01 mg ml at a pH corresponding to physiological levels eg pH 1 8 or moderately soluble in water that is its solubility in water comes from about 1 to 2 mg ml or even weaker solubility in water reaching up to about 1 mg ml and to such high values ak from about 20 to 40 mg ml. The usefulness of the present invention increases with decreasing solubility of the drug. Thus the compositions of the present invention are preferred for low solubility preparations having a solubility of less than 10 mg ml more preferred for low solubility preparations having a solubility of less than 1 mg ml and most preferred for low solubility preparations having a solubility of less than 0 1 mg ml. In general it can be said that the drug has a ratio of solubility in water to a dose of more than 10 ml and more typically more than 100 ml while the solubility of the drug mg ml is the minimum indicator observed in any appropriate physiological aqueous solution for example in solutions with a pH level between 1 and 8 which includes simulated gastric and intestinal buffers of the United States Pharmacopeia USP with the dose indicated in mg. Thus the ratio of water solubility to dose can be calculated by dividing the dose in mg by solubility in mg ml . .Preferred classes of drugs include but are not limited to antihypertensive drugs sedatives anticoagulants anticonvulsants hypoglycemic agents decongestants antihistamines antitussive drugs antitumor drugs beta blockers anti inflammatory drugs antipsychotics used for cognitive disorders cholesterol lowering drugs anti atherosclerotic drugs a agents used in obesity agents used in autoimmune disorders agents used in impotence antibacterial and antifungal agents sleeping pills antiparkinsonian drugs agents used in Alzheimer s disease antibiotics antidepressants antiviral agents glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors and transfer protein cholesteryl ester. . .

Almost any neutral or ionizable polymer whose solubility in water is at least 0.1 mg ml at pH levels ranging from at least 1 to 8 may be suitable. . . .The amphiphilic nature of the polymers is preferred meaning that the polymer has hydrophobic and hydrophilic sites. Amphiphilic polymers are preferred since it is believed that such polymers tend to have relatively strong interactions with the drug and can contribute to the formation of various types of polymer drug blocks in solution. Ionizable polymers are a particularly preferred class of amphiphilic polymers ionized regions of such polymers during ionization comprise at least a portion of the hydrophilic regions of the polymer. . .One class of polymers suitable for use in the present invention contains neutral non cellulosic polymers. Examples of polymers include vinyl polymers and copolymers having at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl alkyl acyloxy and cycloamide vinyl copolymers with at least one hydrophilic hydroxyl containing repeat unit and at least one hydrophobic site an alkyl or aryl containing repeat unit polyvinyl alcohols which at least have a portion of repeatable units in unhydrolyzed vinyl acetate form polyvinyl acetate copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol polyvinylpyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol polyethylene copolymers and polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers also referred to as poloxamers . . EUDRAGITS Rohm Tech Inc. of Malden Massachusetts .Another class of polymers suitable for use in the present invention contains ionizable non cellulosic polymers. Examples of polymers include carboxylic acid functionalized vinyl polymers such as carboxylic acid functionalized polymethacrylates and carboxylic acid functionalized polyacrylates such as EUDRAGITS manufactured by Rohm Tech Inc. of Malden Massachusetts amino functionalized polyacrylates and polymethacrylates high molecular weight proteins such as gelatin and albumin and carboxylic acid functionalized starches such as starch glycolate. . . EUDRAGITS .Non cellulosic amphiphilic polymers are copolymers of relatively hydrophilic and relatively hydrophobic monomers. Examples include copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates. Examples of trademarks of such copolymers include EUDRAGITS which are copolymers of methacrylates and acrylates. 0 05 . . .A preferred class of polymers contains ionizable and neutral or non ionizable cellulosic polymers containing at least one substituent linked by an ester and or ester bond in which the degree of polymer substitution is at least 0.05 for each substituent. It should be noted that in the nomenclature of polymers used here substituents linked by an ether bond are listed before the term cellulose as functional groups connected to an ether group for example ethylbenzoic acid cellulose has ethylbenzoic acid as a substituent. Similarly ester linked substituents as carboxylates are listed after the term cellulose for example cellulose phthalate which has one carboxylic acid in each phthalate functional group linked by an ester bond to the polymer and another carboxylic acid that is not involved in the reaction. . 0 05 2 9 . . 3. .It should also be noted that the name of the polymer for example cellulose acetate phthalate AFC refers to any polymer from the family of cellulose polymers that have acetate and phthalate as substituents linked by ester bonds to a significant fraction of the polymer hydroxyl groups. In general the degree of substitution of each substituent may vary from 0.05 to 2.9 provided that other polymer criteria are met. Degree of substitution refers to the average amount of the identified three hydroxyls per repeat unit of saccharides in the cellulose chain that have been substituted. For example if all hydroxyls in the cellulose chain have been substituted with phthalate the degree of phthalate substitution is 3. Also each type of polymer family includes cellulosic polymers having an additional substituent added in relatively small amounts that do not substantially change the characteristics of the polymer. 3 . . . . . . . . . .Amphiphilic cellulosic polymers contain polymers in which in any or all 3 hydroxyl groups present in each repeated unit of saccharides the original cellulosic polymer has been replaced by at least one relatively hydrophobic substituent. A hydrophobic substituent may be essentially any substituent that can cause the cellulosic polymer to be substantially insoluble in water if the level of substitution or degree of substitution is sufficiently high. Examples of hydrophobic substituents include ester linked alkyl groups such as methyl ethyl propyl butyl etc . or ester linked alkyl groups such as acetate propionate butyrate etc . and ester and or ester bound aryl groups such as phenyl benzoate or phenylate. The hydrophilic regions of the polymer can be either regions that are relatively unsubstituted since unsubstituted hydroxyls are themselves relatively hydrophilic or those that are substituted with hydrophilic substituents. Hydrophilic substituents include ester or ester bonded non ionizable groups such as hydroxyalkyl substituents of hydroxyethyl hydroxypropyl and alkyl ester groups such as ethoxyethoxy or methoxyethoxy. Particularly preferred hydrophilic substituents are ether bound or ester linked ionizable groups such as carboxylic acids thiocarboxylic acids substituted phenoxyl groups amines phosphates or sulfonates. . . . . . . . . . . pH 1 8.One class of cellulosic polymers contains neutral polymers which means that in an aqueous solution the polymers are substantially non ionizable. Such polymers contain non ionizable substituents which may be linked by an ether or ester bond. Examples of ester bonded non ionizable substituents include alkyl groups such as methyl ethyl propyl butyl etc . hydroxyalkyl groups such as hydroxymethyl hydroxyethyl hydroxypropyl etc . and aryl groups such as phenyl. Examples of ester bonded non ionizable substituents include alkyl groups such as acetate propionate butyrate etc . and aryl groups such as phenylate. However in the presence of aryl groups for the polymer it may be necessary to include in it a sufficient amount of a hydrophilic substituent so that the polymer has at least some solubility in water at any physiological pH levels in the range from 1 to 8. .Preferred non ionizable cellulosic polymers suitable for use as polymers include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose hydroxypropyl cellulose methyl cellulose hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose hydroxyethyl cellulose acetate and hydroxyethyl ethyl cellulose. . .A preferred set of non ionizable neutral cellulosic polymers are amphiphilic polymers. Examples of polymers include hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate where cellulose repeat units having a relatively high number of methyl or acetate substituents with respect to unsubstituted hydroxyl or hydroxypropyl substituents form hydrophobic regions relative to other repeat units of the polymer. pH . . . . . . . . . . . pH . .A preferred class of cellulosic polymers contains polymers that are at least partially ionizable at physiological pH levels and include at least one ionizable substituent which can be bound by either an ether or an ester bond. Examples of ionizable ester linked substituents include carboxylic acids such as acetic acid propionic acid benzoic acid salicylic acid alkoxybenzoic acids such as ethoxybenzoic acid or propoxybenzoic acid various isomers of alkoxyphthalic acid such as ethoxyphthalic acid ethoxyisophthalic acid various isomers of alkoxy nicotinic acid such as ethoxy nicotinic acid and various isomers of picolinic acid such as ethoxy picoline acid acid etc . thiocarboxylic acids such as thioacetic acid substituted phenoxyl groups such as hydroxyphenoxyl etc . amines such as ethoxyamine ethoxydiethylamine ethoxytrimethylamine etc . phosphates such as ethoxyphosphate and sulfonates such as ethoxysulfonate. Examples of ionizable ester linked substituents include carboxylic acids such as succinate citrate phthalate terephthalate isophthalate trimellitate and various isomers of pyridinedicarboxylic acid etc . tricarboxylic acids such as thiosuccinate substituted phenoxyl groups such as aminosalicylic acid amines such as natural or synthetic amino acids such as alanine or phenylalanine phosphates such as acetyl phosphate and sulfonates such as acetylsulfonate. However in order for the aromatically substituted polymers to have the desired solubility in water it is also desirable that the corresponding hydrophilic groups such as hydroxypropyl or carboxyl functional groups are connected to the polymer to bring the polymer into a state of solubility in water at pH values at which at least any ionizable groups are ionized. In some cases the aromatic substituent itself may be ionizable for example substituents such as phthalate or trimellitate. pH . pH .Examples of cellulosic polymers that are at least partially ionized at levels of pH appropriate physiological include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate GPMTSAS hydroxypropylmethylcellulose succinate hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate succinate hydroxyethyl succinate hydroxyethyl cellulose acetate succinate hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate HPMCP hydroxyethyl cellulose acetate hydroxyethyl acetate phthalate carboxyethyl cellulose ethyl carboxymethyl cellulose zu also called carboxymethylethylcellulose or CMEC carboxymethyl cellulose cellulose acetate phthalate CAP cellulose acetate methyl cellulose acetate phthalate ethylcellulose cellulose acetate hydroxypropylcellulose hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate phthalate hydroxypropyl atsetatftalatsuktsinat hydroxypropylmethylcellulose atsetosuktsinatftalat hydroxypropylmethylcellulose suktsinatftalat propionatftalat cellulose butiratftalat hydroxypropylcellulose cellulose acetate trimellitate ATC methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate atsetotrimellitat ethylcellulose hydroxypropylcellulose atsetotrimellitat atsetotrimellitat hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hydroxypropylcellulose atsetotrimellitatsuktsinat propionattrimellitat cellulose butirattrimellitat cellulose atsetotereftalat cellulose atsetoizoftalat cellulose atsetopiridindikarboksilat cellulose cellulose acetate salicylate subsalicylate gidroksipropilatsetat cellulose cellulose acetate etilbenzoynokisloy etilbenzoynokisloy hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate cellulose etilftalevokisloy acetate cellulose acetate etilnikotinovokisloy etilpikolinovokisloy and cellulose acetate. The authors of the present invention revealed that of the above cellulose polymers that are at least partially ionized at physiological pH levels HPMCAC HPMCF AFC ATC carboxyethyl cellulose carboxymethyl cellulose and ethyl carboxymethyl cellulose are most preferred. . . . 0 1 . . pKa 10. . . . 60 300256 Pharmaceutical Compositions of Drugs and Neutralized Acidic Polymers 22 2001 .Another preferred class of polymers consists of neutralized acidic polymers. By the term neutralized acidic polymer is meant any acidic polymer in which a significant fraction of acidic functional groups or acidic substituents has been neutralized that is they are in their deprotonated forms. An acidic polymer is any polymer having a significant amount of acidic functional groups. In general a significant amount of acidic functional groups will be about 0.1 milligrams equivalent or more acidic functional groups per gram of polymer. Acid functional groups include any functional groups that are sufficiently acidic and upon contact with them or upon dissolution in water they can at least partially give off the hydrogen cation to water and thereby increase the concentration of hydrogen ions. This definition includes any named functional group or substituent in which the functional group is covalently linked to a polymer whose ionization constant pKa is less than about 10. Examples of classes of functional groups that are included above in the description of the present invention include carboxylic acids thiocarboxylic acids phosphates phenolic groups and sulfonates. Such functional groups may constitute a primary polymer structure such as a polyacrylic acid structure but in a more general sense they are covalently linked to the parent polymer backbone and are thus referred to as substituents . Neutralized acidic polymers are described in more detail in US Patent Application Ser. No. 60 300256 entitled Pharmaceutical Compositions of Drugs and Neutralized Acidic Polymers filed June 22 2001 the relevant disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. . .While particular polymers for use in blended formulations are contemplated as being suitable for the present invention mixtures of such polymers may also be suitable. Thus the term polymer is intended to include a mixture of polymers in addition to a single type of polymer. Increase concentration . . . . . 1 25 2 3 . . 5 10 .A preferred polymer used in the compositions of the present invention is a concentration increasing polymer which implies that at least one and preferably both of the following conditions are met. The first condition is that the polymer increasing the concentration is present in an amount sufficient to increase the maximum concentration of the drug MLA in the environment of use relative to the control composition consisting of an equivalent amount of crystalline drug in its lowest energy form but not in the form of a polymer. That is as soon as the composition enters the environment of use the polymer increases the aqueous concentration of the drug relative to the control composition. It is understood that the control composition does not contain solubilizers or other components that can significantly affect the solubility of the drug and that the drug in the control composition is in solid form. The generally accepted control composition is the undispersed or crystalline form of the drug in its pure form in its lowest energy form and in its lowest solubility form. Preferably the polymer increases the MLA of the drug in an aqueous solution at least 1.25 fold relative to the control composition more preferably at least 2 fold and most preferably at least 3 fold. Amazingly the polymer can lead to an extremely large increase in water concentration. In some cases the MLK of the drug provided by the test composition was at least 5 times to more than 10 times the equilibrium concentration provided in the control.

More specifically compositions containing a drug and increasing the concentration of the polymer provide the value of PPC in the environment of use for any 90 minute period from about 0 to about 270 minutes after introduction into the environment of use which is at least 1.25 times greater than this value in the above control composition. Preferably the value of the AUC that the composition provides at least 2 fold more preferably at least 3 fold exceeds that of the control composition. For some dispersions as described above the test compositions of the present invention can provide an AUC value that is at least 5 fold and even more than 10 fold greater than the AUC value of the control composition. . 1 25 2 3 .In a preferred embodiment the concentration increasing polymer is present in an amount sufficient to ensure that the composition provides an increase in concentration relative to the second control composition consisting of an amorphous drug but not containing a concentration increasing polymer. Preferably the polymer increases at least one value and preferably both the MLK or PPC of the drug in the aqueous solution at least 1.25 fold relative to the second control composition more preferably at least 2 fold and most preferably at least 3 fold. in vivo in vitro .A use environment can be either an in vivo aqueous environment for use such as the gastrointestinal tract GIT of an animal in particular humans and an in vitro aqueous environment for use of a test solution such as phosphate buffered saline PBS or a solution modeling the fasting duodenum MHD . in vitro. in vitro in vivo . 20 Na2HPO4 47 KH2PO4 87 NaCl 0 2 KCl NaOH pH 6 5. 7 3 1 4 1 2 sn 3 . .The resulting amorphous dispersion containing a sparingly soluble drug and increasing the concentration of the polymer formed using the methods of the present invention provides an increased concentration of the dissolved drug in in vitro solubility tests. It was found that an increased concentration of the drug in in vitro solubility tests in MHD solution or in FBI solution is a suitable in vivo indicator of properties and bioavailability. A suitable FBI solution is an aqueous solution containing 20 mmol Na 2 HPO 4 47 mmol KH 2 PO 4 87 mmol NaCl and 0.2 mmol KCl with a pH adjusted to 6.5 with NaOH. A suitable MHD solution is the same FBI solution in which 7.3 mmol of acidic taurocholic sodium and 1.4 mmol of 1 palmitoyl 2 oleyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine are also present. In particular the composition formed by the method of the present invention can be tested for solubility by adding it to MHD or PBS solutions and shaking to facilitate dissolution. in vitro 1 in vitro 2 2 10 3 . 2 10 100 . In vitro tests to evaluate an increase in drug concentration in an aqueous solution can be carried out 1 by adding with agitation a sufficient amount of a control composition usually a single undispersed drug in vitro to a test medium such as MHD or PBS to achieve equilibrium drug concentration facilities 2 in a separate vessel by adding with agitation a sufficient amount of a control composition for example a composition containing a drug and a polymer in the same test medium so that if the whole drug was dissolved the theoretical concentration of the drug would exceed the equilibrium concentration of the drug is at least an amount times 2 and preferably at least an amount times 10 and 3 by comparing the readings of MLK and or aqueous PPC of the test composition in the test medium with an equilibrium concentration and or the aqueous PPC of the control composition. When carrying out the above solubility test an amount of the test composition or control composition is used that provided that the entire drug is dissolved will result in a concentration of the drug that is at least 2 fold preferably at least 10 fold and most preferably at least 100 times greater than the equilibrium concentration. . . 90 270 270 . 30 90 . 90 .The concentration of dissolved drug is usually measured as a function of time by taking samples of the test medium and plotting the concentration of the drug in the test medium versus time so that MLK can be determined. MLK is the maximum value of the concentration of dissolved drug measured over the entire duration of the test. When calculating the aqueous PPC the concentration is summed up depending on the time curve during any 90 minute interval between the time the composition was introduced into the aqueous environment of use when time is zero and up to 270 minutes after the introduction into the environment of use when time is 270 minutes . As a rule when the composition quickly reaches its MLK for example in less than about 30 minutes the time interval over which the PPC is usually calculated is from zero to a time of 90 minutes. However as described above if the AUC of the composition at any 90 minute period meets the criteria of the present invention then the resulting composition is considered to be included in the scope of the present invention. . 0 45 . 13 0 45 Scientific Resources Scientific Resources Inc St. Paul MN TITAN . 13000 G 60 . . 10 40 . .To avoid the presence of large solid particles of the drug that can lead to erroneous calculations the test solution is either filtered or centrifuged. The dissolved drug is usually taken either as a material that passes through a 0.45 micron filter syringe or conversely a material that remains in the supernatant after centrifugation. Filtration can be performed using a 13 mm 0.45 m polyvinylidin difluoride filter syringe supplied by Scientific Resources Scientific Resources Inc. St. Paul MN under the brand name TITAN . Centrifugation is usually carried out in a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube at 13000 G for 60 seconds. Other similar filtration or centrifugation methods may be used to provide useful results. For example when using other types of microfilters it is possible to obtain values slightly higher or lower 10 40 than the values obtained with the above filter but it will remain possible to identify preferred dispersions. It must be recognized that the definition of dissolved drug includes not only monomeric solvated drug molecules but also a wide range of particles such as polymer drug blocks having submicron sizes such as drug aggregations aggregations of polymer and drug mixtures micelles polymer micelles colloidal particles or nanocrystals polymer drug complexes and other similar drug containing hours particles that are present in the filtrate or supernatant in the above solubility test. 1 25 2 3 5 10 . 1 25 10 .On the other hand when administered orally to a human or other mammal a dose of the composition is provided by AUC at a concentration of the drug in the blood serum or plasma which is at least 1.25 times preferably at least 2 times preferably at least 3 times preferably at least 5 times and most preferably at least 10 times the values of PPC observed in the control composition consisting of an equivalent amount of crystalline drug single dosed without any additional polymer. It is noted that such compositions in comparison with the control composition can also be considered to have a relative bioavailability higher than from 1.25 times to a 10 fold excess of this indicator. in vivo . in vivo . in vivo . . . . in vivo Y X . . in vivo. Testing the relative bioavailability of the drug in in vivo compositions in animals or humans can be carried out using conventional methods for measurements of this kind. In vivo tests such as cross sectional testing can be used to determine the ability of a drug composition and to increase polymer concentration to provide an increase in relative bioavailability compared to a control composition as described above. In an in vivo cross sectional study a test composition of a solid amorphous drug and polymer dispersion was given to half of the group of test subjects and after an adequate withdrawal period e.g. one week the same subjects were given a dose of a control composition consisting of an equivalent amount of crystalline drug such as and a test composition but without the presence of polymer . The other half of the group was first given the dose of the control composition followed by the dose of the test composition. The relative bioavailability was measured by the concentration in the blood in serum or plasma depending on the time in the area under the curve PPC determined for the test group divided by the PPC of blood provided by the control composition. Preferably the test control ratio is determined for each subject and then the average ratios of all subjects in the study are found. In vivo PPC can be determined by plotting the concentration of the drug in serum or plasma along the ordinate Y axis versus time on the abscissa X axis . Dosage may be facilitated by the use of a carrier vehicle when administered. The solvent is preferably water but it may also contain materials for suspending the test or control composition although these materials do not dissolve the composition or alter the solubility of the drug in vivo. .Other features and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following examples which are given to illustrate the present invention and do not limit the intended scope of the present invention. 1Example 1 . 1 [2R 4S]4 [ 3 5 ] 2 6 3 4 2H 1 This example demonstrates an improved method of forming an amorphous dispersion of a drug in a concentration increasing polymer.

Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate HPMCAC AQUOT MG available from Shin Etsu Tokyo Japan in acetone. The sprayed solution had a viscosity of about 130 cP. The sprayed solution was pumped using a high pressure pump into a portable type spray dryer Niro type XP Portable Spray Drier with a liquid feed Process vessel [PSD 1] equipped with a high pressure nozzle Spraying Systems SK 80 18 The PSD 1 was also equipped with a 9 inch camera extension and for the gas dispersant had a filter plate having 1 of the cross section. During operation the nozzle was flush with the filter plate. The spray solution was pumped into a spray dryer at a rate of about 280 g min with a spray pressure of 550 psi. inch.

The evaporated solvent and wet drying gas were removed from the spray dryer at an exit temperature of 37 C. The dispersion dried dispersion formed by this method was accumulated in a cyclone and the moist drying gas was removed into the dust chamber then it entered the condenser then to the working heater and then it was recycled back to the spray drying chamber.

As shown in Table 3 the lowest residual solvent content in the particles of the solid amorphous dispersion was observed at a condenser outlet temperature of 1.2 C Example 3 . At lower condenser outlet temperatures and accordingly lower solvent vapor pressures in the drying gas the residual solvent content increases. Similarly at a higher condenser outlet temperature of 8.9 C Example 4 the level of residual solvent increases to 4.8 wt. . Thus by incorporating a small amount of solvent vapor into the drying gas a lower residual solvent content can be obtained. in a solid amorphous dispersion than when using a dry drying gas. With an increase in the solvent vapor content in the drying gas the specific volume of particles of the solid amorphous dispersion also decreases. 5 6Examples 5 6 1 Niro PSD 2 . 4 . 1 12 .

In addition, it has antithrombotic effect in vivo, can inhibit platelet release reaction, inhibit platelet aggregation, and can be used for preventing cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease.</div>\\n      <div id=\"p0005\" num=\"0005\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Salicylic acid is a hydrolysate of aspirin, is a main factor of aspirin causing digestive tract irritation, and the content of the salicylic acid is one of important indexes for evaluating the quality of an aspirin preparation. The content of salicylic acid in aspirin is regulated in pharmacopoeia not to exceed 1.5%.</div>\\n      <div id=\"p0006\" num=\"0006\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The existing aspirin enteric-coated tablet belongs to a unit preparation, and is mainly absorbed in the small intestine, and the randomness of gastric emptying time causes the time difference of the aspirin tablet entering the small intestine to be larger; after eating, the gastric emptying rate is reduced, so that the time for the aspirin tablet to enter the small intestine is delayed, and the absorption of the aspirin tablet is delayed; therefore, the variation of aspirin is large in individuals and among individuals, and the same individual takes medicine T at different time intervals<sub>max</sub>Are also inconsistent; compared with the common dosage form, the delayed drug absorption of the aspirin enteric-coated tablet leads to C after the administration<sub>max</sub>The bioavailability is obviously reduced, so that the antiplatelet effect is weakened and the drug effect is reduced; and acute symptoms of patients cannot be quickly relieved due to delayed drug absorption. Therefore, the improvement on the original enteric-coated tablet dosage form and the reduction of the free salicylic acid content in the aspirin enteric-coated tablet have very important significance.</div>\\n      <div id=\"p0007\" num=\"0007\" class=\"description-paragraph\">CN201410310585.7 discloses an aspirin enteric-coated sustained-release capsule and a preparation method thereof, the formulation of the capsule contains 30-60% of aspirin, 30-60% of a filling agent, 1-10% of a release regulator and 2-20% of a framework material, wherein the filling agent is one or more of mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, lactose, sucrose, glucose, starch, dextrin, pregelatinized starch and microcrystalline cellulose; the release regulator is one or more of sodium carboxymethyl starch, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose; the skeleton material is one or more of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, carbomer, sodium alginate and stearic acid.</div>\\n      <div id=\"p0008\" num=\"0008\" class=\"description-paragraph\">CN201210344710.7 provides a preparation process of aspirin enteric-coated tablets without a granulation step, and aspirin enteric-coated tablets with low salicylic acid content prepared by the preparation process.

In addition, it has antithrombotic effect in vivo, can inhibit platelet release reaction, inhibit platelet aggregation, and can be used for preventing cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease.\n",
            "Salicylic acid is a hydrolysate of aspirin, is a main factor of aspirin causing digestive tract irritation, and the content of the salicylic acid is one of important indexes for evaluating the quality of an aspirin preparation. The content of salicylic acid in aspirin is regulated in pharmacopoeia not to exceed 1.5%.\n",
            "The existing aspirin enteric-coated tablet belongs to a unit preparation, and is mainly absorbed in the small intestine, and the randomness of gastric emptying time causes the time difference of the aspirin tablet entering the small intestine to be larger; after eating, the gastric emptying rate is reduced, so that the time for the aspirin tablet to enter the small intestine is delayed, and the absorption of the aspirin tablet is delayed; therefore, the variation of aspirin is large in individuals and among individuals, and the same individual takes medicine T at different time intervalsmaxAre also inconsistent; compared with the common dosage form, the delayed drug absorption of the aspirin enteric-coated tablet leads to C after the administrationmaxThe bioavailability is obviously reduced, so that the antiplatelet effect is weakened and the drug effect is reduced; and acute symptoms of patients cannot be quickly relieved due to delayed drug absorption. Therefore, the improvement on the original enteric-coated tablet dosage form and the reduction of the free salicylic acid content in the aspirin enteric-coated tablet have very important significance.\n",

            "On the other hand, the invention provides a preparation method of aspirin enteric-coated micro-tablet capsules, which comprises the following specific steps:\n",
            "1) uniformly mixing aspirin, an excipient, a disintegrating agent, an adhesive and a glidant to prepare a total mixed material;\n",
            "2) tabletting the total mixed material to obtain micro tablets;\n",
            "3) spraying the enteric coating solution into a container containing the plain micro-tablets for coating, and air drying to obtain coated tablets;\n",
            "4) filling the coated tablet into a capsule shell to prepare the aspirin enteric-coated micro-tablet capsule.\n",
            "Further, the die size in the tabletting process is one of 2mm or 3mm diameter circular punches.\n",
            "Further, the preparation process of the enteric coating liquid is as follows: and (3) uniformly mixing the film coating material, the plasticizer and the anti-sticking agent with purified water to form the coating.\n",
            "Further, the coating process is as follows: controlling the air inlet temperature to be 40-50 ℃, the air outlet temperature to be 30-40 ℃, the pressure to be 4-6 MPa, spraying the enteric coating liquid by a spray gun at the flow rate of 1-10 ml/min until coating is finished, and air-drying at 30-50 ℃ to obtain the coated tablet. The coating process of the invention adopts spray gun spraying and air drying, quickly air-dries the water attached to the aspirin micro-tablets, reduces the influence of water on aspirin hydrolysis, and ensures the stability and purity of the prepared aspirin micro-tablets.\n",
            "The preparation of the invention is prepared by mixing the component materials, and the mixing mode can be various, such as: micro-jet, stirring, shaking and the like, and aims to improve the stability and the uniformity of the mixture.\n",
            "The aspirin enteric-coated micro-tablet capsule prepared by the invention is prepared by firstly pressing a micro-tablet with the diameter of 2-3 mm, then coating the micro-tablet with enteric coating and then filling the micro-tablet into the capsule. It is a novel multi-unit drug delivery preparation, and has the advantages of pellets and tablets.\n",
            "Compared with enteric pellet capsules, the enteric pellet capsule has the following advantages:\n",
            "1) the micro-tablets have more regular shapes, smooth and beautiful surfaces and more uniform sizes, and have smaller difference between batches of the preparation by adopting a plurality of filling modes when filling capsules;\n",
            "2) water or an organic solvent is needed in the preparation process of the pellets, aspirin is easy to hydrolyze when meeting water, and strict explosion-proof treatment is needed in a workshop when the organic solvent is adopted; the preparation process of the micro-tablet can adopt a powder direct tabletting method without introducing a solvent, so that the influence of water and heat on the API in the preparation process is avoided;\n",
            "3) the coating process of the pellets is generally carried out in a fluidized bed, fine powder formed by fast drying of API solution in the spray medicine feeding process is easy to lose through a fluidized bed collecting bag, and the medicine feeding rate is not high; the preparation of the micro-tablets adopts a powder direct tabletting method, and the micro-tablets are coated, so that the obvious loss of effective medicine materials in the tablet core containing the medicine is avoided, and the product yield is high.\n",
            "Compared with enteric capsules, the enteric-coated capsule has the following advantages:\n",
            "the enteric capsule is easily twisted and broken in the capsule shell due to the influence of food extrusion and the like in the stomach, so that the medicine is easily released in the stomach in advance; because the enteric capsule is generally large in size, the whole capsule is difficult to enter the intestinal tract through pylorus, so that the release of the medicine is delayed, and the difference of the medicine in the release process in vivo is large;\n",
            "the enteric-coated micro-tablet capsule shell prepared by the invention is dissolved in the stomach, the micro-tablet in the capsule has smaller volume, can smoothly enter the intestinal tract through pylorus, and the medicine release time is more stable. The enteric-coated micro-tablets are enteric-coated, so that the micro-tablets can be prevented from being dissolved in the stomach in advance, the drug can be released in the intestines, and the individual difference is avoided.\n",
            "Compared with enteric-coated tablets, the enteric-coated tablet has the following advantages:\n",
            "1) compared with the common enteric-coated tablet, the micro-tablet has larger contact surface with digestive juice in the intestinal tract and faster release speed, can obviously improve the defect that the common enteric-coated tablet can not quickly relieve acute symptoms caused by delayed absorption, and can effectively improve the bioavailability of aspirin;\n",
            "2) the micro-tablet capsule of the invention is quickly dissolved in the capsule shell in the stomach to release the micro-tablets, and because the micro-tablets have smaller volume and are a plurality of micro-tablets, the time of the medicine entering the intestinal tract is less influenced by the emptying rate of the stomach, thus being beneficial to reducing the variation in individuals and between individuals caused by the factors such as the difference of the emptying time of the stomach and the like and leading the time curve of the medicine to be more stable.\n",
            "3) The drug release behavior of the micro-tablet is the sum of the drug release behaviors of a plurality of small units forming one dose, the fault or defect of the preparation of the individual tablet can not generate great influence on the whole drug release behavior, and the difference of drug absorption caused by the difference of preparation batches or between batches is avoided.\n",
            "Compared with the prior art, the invention has the following advantages:\n",
            "according to the invention, by adopting a powder direct tabletting method, a solvent is not required to be introduced, the API is prevented from being influenced by water and heat in the preparation process, the use of an organic solvent and water is avoided in the tablet core preparation process, the solvent residue is reduced, meanwhile, the hydrolysis of aspirin is avoided, and the stability of the preparation and storage processes is improved; the coating material adopts enteric-coated auxiliary materials, so that the hydrolysis in the stomach in advance is avoided, and the individual detection difference is reduced; in a word, the invention provides aspirin enteric-coated micro-tablets which have good stability, small adverse reaction, stable blood concentration and high bioavailability.\n",
            "The aspirin enteric-coated micro-tablet capsule prepared by the invention can ensure that the medicine is uniformly and slowly released to an intestinal tract, reduce the irritation of the mucous membrane and reduce the variation in the medicine in individuals and among individuals caused by irregular release.\n",
            "The aspirin is prepared into enteric-coated micro-tablet capsules, and the enteric-coated micro-tablet capsules are contacted with intestinal liquid after oral administration, so that the total surface area contacted with digestive juice can be increased, the release and dissolution of the medicine are enhanced, the dispersion, dissolution and stable absorption of the medicine are promoted, and the bioavailability of an individual is improved. Meanwhile, the medicine can be released stably and slowly, so that serious adverse reaction of a digestive system caused by overhigh blood medicine concentration after taking the medicine can be avoided, the influence caused by unqualified dissolution can also be avoided, the adverse reaction is obviously reduced, and the curative effect is improved.\n",
            "Detailed Description\n",
            "The invention will be further illustrated with reference to the following specific examples. These examples are intended to illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.\n",
